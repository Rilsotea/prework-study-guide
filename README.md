# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This project was to get ready for the bootcamp I will be taking apart in coming up shortly.
Following the steps of the prework section of this bootcamp I was able to get some experience with the types of coding that will take place.
What I have learned from this prework is how to coding at a basic level and understand a small amount of future things to come.

## Usage

Each section of this Prework Study Guide has some notes on what I leanred ranging fomr HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript. If one wants to randomly learn about one of these opening the DevTools and going to console can suggest at random what to learn for the day. When at the console you will see the list of topics one can learn from if you wish to not follow the randomly suggested topic.
